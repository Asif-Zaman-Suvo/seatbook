# Seatbook

Seat booking for small venues. Organizers publish an event with a seat grid, attendees pick a seat and book it.

## Stack

- **server/**: Node, Express, TypeScript, Prisma, Postgres
- **client/**: React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind

## Run it

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

- App: http://localhost:5173
- API: http://localhost:4000
- Postgres: `localhost:5433` (user / password / db: `seatbook`)

The database is migrated and seeded on first start. To start from a clean database: `docker compose down -v`.

**After changing `schema.prisma`:** create the migration from your machine (`cd server && npx prisma migrate dev`, with `DATABASE_URL` pointing at `localhost:5433`), then `docker compose restart server`. The server regenerates the Prisma client and applies migrations on start.

### Seeded accounts

All passwords are `password123`.

| Email | Role |
|---|---|
| organizer@seatbook.test | Organizer |
| alice@seatbook.test | Attendee |
| bob@seatbook.test | Attendee |

### Without Docker

```bash
cd server && cp .env.example .env && npm install && npm run db:migrate && npm run db:seed && npm run dev
cd client && npm install && npm run dev
```

You need a Postgres running at the `DATABASE_URL` in `server/.env`.
